> How much variance in my daily affect (anxiety & depression) can be attributed to behavioral decisions?


### change note

I've changed the available questionnaire responses away from a `disagree-neutral-agree` (scores from 1-7) to a time based `not at all - half the day - most of the day` (scored from 1-5). See [commit](https://github.com/ConstantinoSchillebeeckx/oolong/commit/1bc9174a0a1ac6155a687c32d5ed85b5da106202).
